# Using-GIS-to-Optimize-Presidential-Campaigns

## View the Powerpoint Presentation (with route graphics) in the repo! (GIS Presentation.pptx)

This project utilizes data from the 2016 US Presidential Election. Specifically, the project determines the number of votes in a state is "up for grabs" at any given time. This term refers to the number of citizens who are registered to vote and claim themselves as undecided. Information is taken for several months leading up to the November election. Using this information and other geospatial data, the project attempts to create a "perfect" campaign route. 

Note: the campaign route itself is drawn by hand, but if one chooses to purchase an arcGIS add-on that draws the shortest route, this manual route can be refined further.
